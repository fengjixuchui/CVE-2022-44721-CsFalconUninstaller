# Crowdstrike Falcon Uninstaller
CrowdStrike Falcon is a cloud-powered endpoint detection and response
(EDR) and antivirus (AV)  solution. On each end-device  a lightweight
managed  sensor  is  deployed  and  makes  use  of  the   cloud-based
capabilities.  The  sensor  can   be  configured  with  a   uninstall
protection.  It  prevents the  uninstallation  of CrowdStrike  Falcon
sensor on the end-device without a one-time generated token.

Exploiting this vulnerability allows  an attacker with administrative
privileges to  bypass the token  check on Windows end-devices  and to
uninstall the  sensor from  the device without  proper authorization,
effectively removing the device's EDR and AV protection.

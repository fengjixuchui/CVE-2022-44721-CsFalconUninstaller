# CVE-2022-44721 Crowdstrike Falcon Uninstaller
CrowdStrike Falcon is a cloud-powered endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus (AV) solution. On each end-device a kernel level managed sensor is deployed  and makes use of the cloud-based capabilities. The sensor can be configured with a uninstall protection. It prevents the uninstallation of CrowdStrike Falcon sensor on the end-device without a one-time generated token.

Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker with administrative privileges to bypass the token check on Windows end-devices and to uninstall the sensor from  the device without proper authorization, effectively removing the device's EDR and AV protection.

Vulnerable sensor version: 6.44.15806
